## CFGEdit
# v1.0
CFGEdit creates, edits, and manages your game config files

# Getting Started
CFGEdit itself is a simple interface, letting users set various options for games and modules before adding available commands. Once the user has completed all the necessary changes, the final product is simply saved as a .cfg file, ready to be used by the chosen game.

# Modules
Modules are the file containing the various config parameters. They can be created by anyone wanting to add support for a particular game title and shared between all users. The file itself is quite easy to create. The module is a text-based system which operates on a line-by-line basis. Simply separate each parameter by lines, with each parameter itself containing three parts - a name, a syntax, and a description - each separated by a semicolon (;).

* CFGEdit currently supports Quake2 configs with an included Module (Quake2 and all its properties belong to Id Software).
